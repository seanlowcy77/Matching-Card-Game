# Matching Card Game

## 1. Introduction

A Matching Card game developed with Swift and Xcode. This game was done following a tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymQpuxCGptU&list=PLMRqhzcHGw1YdahNsCLZdSVfNv0stwvdx)
A Video Demo of the App is available below:

## 2. Quick Start

To run the app, you need to run it on your own IOS device (using a USB cable) using XCode. You may use the simulator to run the game. Once you open XCode, simply click the 'run' button on Xcode.

## 3. Features

### a. Card Matching / Flipping

It has a total of 16 cards - basically 8 pairs. The user can win by flipping over all the cards correctly! Should a pair match, the pair of cards will disappear. Otherwise, it will flip back downwards.

### b. Time Limit

Its rather impossible but players have only 10 seconds to finish the game! Nevertheless, this timer may be changed if you wish.

### c. Play again function

Allows the user to play the game again should the player lose.

## 4. Requirements

-   IOS 13.0+
-   Running with XCode 11.7

## 5. Notes

There are multiple comments written within the code that may help with your understanding with what is going on. Nevertheless I encourage those who are new to Xcode or Swift to check out the tutorial link above. Have fun!
